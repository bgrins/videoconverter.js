#videoconverter.js

videoconverter.js is a library that allows you to convert and manipulate videos inside of your web browser.

This is achieved by converting the popular [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) library into JavaScript, using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

It was originally conceived for a project called [Video Funhouse](http://nodeknockout.com/teams/devcomo) in Node Knockout 2013.
