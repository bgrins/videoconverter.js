Description:
Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms
(Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, Symbian, etc).  Based on the
xUnit architecture.  Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set of
assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and non-fatal
failures, various options for running the tests, and XML test report
generation.

Local Modifications:
- Removed unused declarations of kPathSeparatorString to have warning
  free build.
- Added GTEST_ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED_ to test registering dummies in TEST_P
  and INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P to remove warnings about unused variables
  under GCC 5.
